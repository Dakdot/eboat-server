# SIT E-boat Shore Server

## About The Project

This program is the server side of the shore computer program. It is what the boat connects and sends data to. This application will then store that data in a database and propagate it to all connected clients.

See [Dakdot/eboat-client](https://github.com/Dakdot/eboat-client) for the client side of the shore computer.

### Built With

- Express.js
- Prisma

## Getting Started

This section will help you download, build, and run the program for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. First ensure that `node.js` is installed on your system:

```
node -v
```

If it is not, consider checking out a Node version manager such as [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Instructions on how to set up each of them are included in their respective READMEs.

2. Then, you must clone the repository to your local system:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dakdot/eboat-server.git
```
